## Info

My name is Clay M, I'm an undergrad student at JCUB.
This repository is the showcase of my practicals for my programming 2 course.

## Things I've learnt

A list of at least 3 main lessons you have learned about "clean code" in this subject.

* Follow the provided patterns and expected coding standards
* Consistency makes the code much easier to read and makes errors stand out
* Start with planning
